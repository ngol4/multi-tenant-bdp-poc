# Multi-Tenant Big Data Platform Proof of Concept

## Overview
This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a multi-tenant Big Data Platform (BDP). The project demonstrates a multi-tenant architecture for data processing and management, showcasing the capabilities of handling multiple clients or tenants within a single data platform.

## Features
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Supports multiple clients with isolated data processing environments.
- **Data Processing**: Efficient management and processing of large datasets.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging functionality to track data processing activities.
- **Report Generation**: Automated generation of reports for data analysis and insights.
- **Documentation**: Well-structured documentation and assignment report included.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python (97.7% of the codebase)
- **Scripting**: Shell scripting (2.3% of the codebase)
- **Data Processing Framework**: [Details available in the code folder]
